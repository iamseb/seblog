Whilst some richly-featured professional applications exist for generating flora in a procedural fashion for high-end rendering, there are precious few systems available for the kind of bulk task that I require.<\/p>\n<p>At first the task of generating plants might seem like a massive endeavour. The various permutations of stem widths, lengths, branch frequency, colour variation, leaf size, shape, frequency and mind-boggling. And that&#8217;s not even considering the problem space represented by flowers.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, the problem of representing self-similar biological development is one that attracted Aristid Lindenmayer, who in 1968 introduced <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/L-system\">L-Systems<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; as a theoretical framework for studying the development of simple multicellular organisms, and subsequently applied to investigate higher plants and plant organs. After the incorporation of geometric features, plant models expressed using L-systems became detailed enough to allow the use of computer graphics for realistic visualization of plant structures and developmental processes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>(Lindenmayer&#8217;s book <a href=\"http:\/\/algorithmicbotany.org\/papers\/#abop\">The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants<\/a> is no longer in print, but is available for free in PDF.)<\/p>\n<p>L-Systems are remarkably powerful, simple systems that express the development of a formal grammar through a parallel rewriting process. In effect, you start with a string that represents certain graphical operations, and a set of rules for rewriting the string. You iterate over the string a certain number of times, and are left with a final product.<\/p>\n<p>For example in a 2D system, the symbol F represents drawing a straight line in a forward direction, the symbol + represents rotating left, and &#8211; represents rotating right. If you start with the string &#8220;F&#8221;, and a rule that says &#8220;(F \u2192 F+F\u2212F\u2212F+F)&#8221;, then you&#8217;d see the following iterations:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>F+F-F-F+F<\/li>\n<li>F+F-F-F+F+F+F-F-F+F-F+F-F-F+F-F+F-F-F+F+F+F-F-F+F<\/li>\n<li>F+F-F-F+F+F+F-F-F+F-F+F-F-F+F-F+F-F-F+F+F+F-F-F+F+ F+F-F-F+F+F+F-F-F+F-F+F-F-F+F-F+F-F-F+F+F+F-F-F+F- F+F-F-F+F+F+F-F-F+F-F+F-F-F+F-F+F-F-F+F+F+F-F-F+F- F+F-F-F+F+F+F-F-F+F-F+F-F-F+F-F+F-F-F+F+F+F-F-F+F+ F+F-F-F+F+F+F-F-F+F-F+F-F-F+F-F+F-F-F+F+F+F-F-F+F<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you then plot those rules using a unit vector length and an angle of 90 degrees, you end up with the following iterations:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><img title=\"Koch Square 1\" src=\"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/1\/18\/Square_koch_1.svg\/40px-Square_koch_1.svg.png\" alt=\"Single iteration of a Koch Square\" width=\"40\" height=\"20\" \/><\/li>\n<li><img title=\"Koch Square 2\" src=\"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/e\/ec\/Square_koch_2.svg\/100px-Square_koch_2.svg.png\" alt=\"Second iteration of a Koch Square\" width=\"100\" height=\"50\" \/><\/li>\n<li><img title=\"Koch Square 3\" src=\"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d6\/Square_koch_3.svg\/280px-Square_koch_3.svg.png\" alt=\"Third iteration of a Koch Square\" width=\"280\" height=\"140\" \/><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There are several more symbols that can be applied to the graphical operations, including pushing the current position and orientation onto a stack and popping it off again, rotations in 3D, and operations to define closed polygons and moving through colour and size lookup tables.<\/p>\n<p>The most basic type of L-System is the deterministic context-less system, D0L, where each operation is independent and will always produce the same output.

Again, I was proven wrong when I loaded up the first Deep Breathing exercise.

The general goal is to provide a storage back-end for Django that isn&#8217;t dependent on the traditional vertically-scaling database server, but can scale horizontally in the same way as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/EC2-AWS-Service-Pricing\/b\/ref=sc_fe_l_2?ie=UTF8&amp;node=201590011\">EC2<\/a> computing cloud does. My eventual goal being the ability to deploy Django in the cloud with no external dependencies. Just throw out a Django machine image, deploy your app&#8217;s code and config, and you have a scaling solution that takes minutes rather than days or weeks.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a non-trivial exercise that is both stimulating and frustrating in equal measure, and progress has been steady, if not exactly rapid. It&#8217;s worth it to me though, as the ability to roll out scaling infrastructure is dramatically hampered by the database layer.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine my delight then to find that Google have launched <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/appengine\/\">AppEngine<\/a>, their own cloud-based web application system. It&#8217;s Python without any messy machine-based libraries, uses <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsgi.org\/wsgi\">WSGI<\/a> so you can use pretty much any Python web app, and with <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.google.com\/papers\/gfs.html\">GFS<\/a> for a distributed file storage and <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.google.com\/papers\/bigtable.html\">BigTable<\/a> as a data persistence layer. Google even throws in Django 0.96.1 with instructions on how to use their storage layers by doing away with Django&#8217;s own model\u00a0 (more on this later).<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.b-list.org\/weblog\/2008\/apr\/08\/batteries-sold-separately\/\">whining about how Google&#8217;s solution cripples Python<\/a> (which is crazy when you look at how trivial it is to refactor code to use Google&#8217;s supplied alternatives), and locks you into their solution. I suspect that this is mostly from people who have never even contemplated building an application that needs to really scale, and are therefore still thinking in terms services provided by the underlying OS. That&#8217;s a big problem for scaling, because disk, IO, threads, sockets, etc are finite resources that are hardware-bound. Abstracting access to these things is tough. Most scaling solutions these days are about providing multiple hardware instances, but unfortunately that only solves the hardware problem. Building an app that scales transparently over multiple hardware instances is a huge challenge in comparison to procuring more servers.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s approach is to do away with the concept of hardware entirely. That means a change of mindset towards every request being an atomic operation. Persistence occurs (correctly) in your persistence layer and not in transient storage available to an instance of your application. Google have provided extensive Python libraries and API calls to enable applications to take advantage of this, but it seems that a fairly vocal group aren&#8217;t interested unless their applications work on AppEngine without any additional effort. Considering the paradigm shift that AppEngine represents (from machine-centric programming to distributed programming) it&#8217;s not unreasonable to expect some small effort to be required. Especially when you take into account that AppEngine is currently in a very limited trial phase.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m extremely optimistic that Google&#8217;s approach will work well for a number of reasons. As an application programmer I spend huge amounts of time working around hardware and platform limitations that I should be spending on core functional areas. If Google can provide a solution that means I never have to worry about specific hardware problems ever again, I doubt I&#8217;ll look back.<\/p>","excerpt":"<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been putting some time into writing a database adapter for Django that uses Amazon&#8217;s S3 and SimpleDB services as a storage layer, whilst trying to retain as much of Django&#8217;s QuerySet functional layer as possible.

In most circumstances it was accompanied by under-informed and wildly inaccurate comments and extrapolations about the BBC from people who have either never worked there, or not worked there in the better part of a decade. (I&#8217;ve also spent far too much time over the past couple of days deleting comments along the lines of &#8220;this is why we should abolish the licence fee&#8221;, strangely most of these comments coming from Americans.)<\/p>\n<p>A lot of people missed the point of what I was writing about, which I&#8217;ll attribute to me not making myself sufficiently clear. I was not talking about the BBC&#8217;s web sites, about the quality of the corporation&#8217;s creative output, nor about what the situation was prior to the sell-off of BBC Technology several years ago. What I was talking about are the reasons that today, in 2007, the BBC is stuck with an archaic technological infrastructure, and how that ultimately hurts the BBC&#8217;s long-term strategy to be &#8220;part of the web&#8221; and not just a set of web pages.<\/p>\n<p>You see, despite the critical handicap of its infrastructure, <strong>the BBC does amazing things with its content<\/strong>. It takes a little longer than the rest of the industry to get those things out there, but considering the size of the corporation, the all-encompassing nature of its audience, and its risk-averse leadership, that&#8217;s not surprising.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also true that the BBC suffers from multiple personality disorder, and that within the corporation not all things are equal. As was pointed out in the comments on my article, BBC Journalism (what used to be BBC News) has its own infrastructure that lies more within the control of the BBC. The difference is clear &#8211; BBC News has to be able to respond in the most flexible and reliable manner imaginable as the changing pressures of world events and audiences demand more of their infrastructure than almost any other in the world. Waiting months for bug-fixes and code reviews to make minor changes would be the kiss of death for the BBC&#8217;s News offerings.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s really the crux of the matter. The BBC certainly can be slow to react to change, but over the past couple of years there has been enormous pressure from within the corporation to move forwards with this whole &#8220;internet&#8221; thing. It&#8217;s safe to say that the vast majority of the people working in on-line content at the BBC do actually &#8220;get it&#8221;, and even the traditional linear media people are catching on. There are some truly exceptional projects coming out of the BBC in the near future (especially on the CBBC and CBeebies side of things), and it&#8217;s not fair to tar everyone with the same brush.<\/p>\n<p>A brilliant example of what the BBC does right is described in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oreillynet.com\/onlamp\/blog\/2007\/12\/perl_on_rails_what_the_bbc_doe.html\">Curtis Poe&#8217;s response to my article<\/a>.

They&#8217;re obviously rather proud of themselves, and I understand that internally the project is making waves. Whilst I applaud the technical achievement of the individual developers, I deplore the situation that has forced them to do this.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that the BBC doesn&#8217;t control its own technical infrastructure. In an act of staggering short-sightedness it was outsourced to Siemens as part of a much wider divesting of the BBC Technology unit. In typical fashion for the BBC, they managed to select a technology supplier without internet operations experience. We can only assume that this must have seemed like an acceptable risk to the towering intellects running the BBC at the time. Certainly the staff at ground level knew what this meant, and resigned <span style=\"font-style: italic\">en masse<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Several years later this puts the BBC in the unenviable situation of having an incumbent technology supplier which takes a least-possible-effort approach to running the BBC&#8217;s internet services. In my time at the BBC, critical operational tasks were known to take days or even weeks despite a contractual service level promising four hour response times. Actual code changes for deploying new applications were known to take months. An upgrade to provide less than a dozen Linux boxes for additional server capacity &#8211; a project that was over a year old when I joined the BBC &#8211; was still being debated by Siemens when I left, eighteen months later.<\/p>\n<p>The BBC&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/support.bbc.co.uk\/support\/rrd\">infrastructure<\/a> is shockingly outdated, having changed only by fractions over the past decade. Over-priced Sun Enterprise servers running Solaris and Apache provide the front-end layer. This is round-robin load balanced, there&#8217;s no management of session state, no load-based connection pool. The front-end servers proxy to the application layer, which is a handful of Solaris machines running Perl 5.6 &#8211; a language that was superseded with the release of Perl 5.8 over five and a half years ago. Part of the reason for this is the bizarre insistence that any native modules or anything that can call code of any kind must be removed from the standard libraries and replaced with a neutered version of that library by a Siemens engineer.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Yes, that&#8217;s right, Siemens forks Perl to remove features that their engineers don&#8217;t like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This means that developers working at the BBC might not be able to code against documented features or interfaces because Siemens can, at their sole discretion, remove or change code in the standard libraries of the sole programming language in use. It also means that patches to the language, and widely available modules from CPAN may be several major versions out of date &#8211; if they are available at all. The recent deployment of Template Toolkit to the BBC servers is one such example &#8211; Siemens took years and objected to this constantly, and when finally they assented to provide the single most popular template language for Perl, they removed all code execution functions from the language.<\/p>\n<p>So talented, underpaid, and frustrated software engineers at the BBC are forced to make a decision. Either they can produce websites using static HTML, and make a few remote calls to limited Perl functions, decorating their page with SSIs, or they can fight against a reticent and incompetent technology supplier to make use of a crippled and outdated language on servers that more than likely are unable to meet the capacity requirements of a dynamic application being used by the BBC&#8217;s audience. Software engineers at the BBC must become masters of the sleight-of-hand, using every smoke and mirrors tactic they can to conjure the appearance of dynamic websites, not exactly what you would expect from one of the largest media corporations in the world. Oh, and if you&#8217;re an external agency working for the BBC and hoping to write a new application or build on technologies that the rest of the world has taken for granted for the best part of a decade, you might as well forget it. There&#8217;s only one externally available development server, and it&#8217;s not in synchronisation with the live environments.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. If, instead of forcing its teams to waste valuable license fee payers&#8217; money on duplicating existing free software, the BBC decided to take control of its technical infrastructure and provide a viable platform for complex, dynamic applications, then that creativity, effort, and time could be directed at making more of the kind of applications that make the BBC great.<\/p>\n<p>Some work is already progressing in this direction. A large part of the BBC&#8217;s Creative Futures project is what the BBC calls &#8220;BBC 2.0&#8243; (often mistakenly referred to by executives and television-types as &#8220;Web 2.0&#8243;). The last I heard this was planning to deploy an architecture based around Java, Tomcat, Hibernate, Velocity, and MySQL. Whilst I disagree with the choice of technology for many reasons, this is at least an important step in the right direction for the BBC &#8211; as long as they exert control over the infrastructure from end to end.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a ridiculous situation, and I know that many talented and respected technical staff have left the BBC in the past few years citing frustration at the insufficient technical infrastructure, and the inability of both Siemens and BBC management to keep up with the pace of technological change. Unfortunately, unless something dramatic changes with the upper levels of BBC management to recognise the nature of the problem, it&#8217;s a situation that will remain the status quo for a long time to come.<br \/>\n<!-- technorati tags begin --><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: right\">Tags: <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/bbc\">bbc<\/a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/technology\">technology<\/a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/tag\/%20rant\"> rant<\/a><\/p>\n<p><!-- technorati tags end --><\/p>","excerpt":"<p>Perl on Rails is a project by the smart chaps over in BBC Audio and Music Interactive that replicates the Ruby On Rails MVC framework in Perl.

Siemens just commission hardware\/software according to BBC spec.  i.e. the BBC mandate that Siemens run Solaris and a home brew version of Perl (e.g. due to InfoSec requirements).  There&#8217;s an architecture team in the BBC (FM&amp;T) who specify this stuff and are completely empowered to change the stack if they want to.  If you asks the Siemens&#8217; architects that support the BBC they absolutely would not agree with the current stack and would love to be moving this stuff forward.<br \/>\n- You can&#8217;t say Siemens as a technology supplier does not have internet ops experience because then you are implying that the BBC does not have that experience.
